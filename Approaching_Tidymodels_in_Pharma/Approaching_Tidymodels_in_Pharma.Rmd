# Interest in machine learning (ML) in pharma has increased rapidly over the last 10 years. This talk is for those new to ML in pharma.  cost of pharmaceutical R&D was doubling every decade A new drug typically takes more than a decade to develop, at a cost of almost $3 billion  drugmakers and investors are spending billions of dollars to turbocharge the search for new treatments using artificial intelligence

# FDA & ML

- **ML had a big focus at the 2021 FDA Science Forum**
- [2021 FDA Science Forum](https://www.fda.gov/media/149502/download)
- [AI/ML-Based Software as a Medical Device Action Plan](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-releases-artificial-intelligencemachine-learning-action-plan)
- [Pharmacometrics & Neural Networks](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/regulatory-science-research-and-education/new-approach-pharmacometrics-recurrent-neural-networks-modeling-drug-exposure-and-drug-response)
- (ML/DL) methods have been increasingly used across many stages of the drug development process
- E.g. drug discovery, digital imaging, disease diagnostics, genetic testing, adverse event detection, trial recruitment, real-world data & drug repurposing etc.

# CORE TIDYMODELS PACKAGES
- tidymodels
- rsample
- parsnip
- recipes
- workflows
- yardstick
- tune
- broom
---



class: panel-narrow-slide, left

# Setup & Use
- Install many of the packages in the tidymodels ecosystem by running: install.packages("tidymodels")
- Run library(tidymodels) to load the core packages and make them available in your current R session.

# The “pit of success”...is the philosophy that users shouldn’t have to strive and struggle to do the right thing. They should be able to fall into good habits almost by accident...The brilliant insight of the recipes packages is that each of those feature engineering steps is itself a model that needs to be trained!
