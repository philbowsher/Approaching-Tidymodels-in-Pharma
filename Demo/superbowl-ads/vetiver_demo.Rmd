## The MLOps cycle

![MLOps cycle](Vetiver_cycle_slide3.png)

*from Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModelOps>*

Data scientists have effective tools that they ‚ù§Ô∏è to:

-   collect data

-   prepare, manipulate, refine data

-   train models

There is a lack üò© of effective tools (especially open source) to:

-   put models into production

-   monitor model performance

-   trigger retraining

## What is vetiver? <https://vetiver.tidymodels.org/>

> *Vetiver, the oil of tranquility, is used as a stabilizing ingredient in perfumery to preserve more volatile fragrances.*

The **goal** of vetiver is to provide fluent tooling to **version, share, deploy, and monitor** a trained model.

## Build a model

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
superbowl_ads_raw <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-03-02/youtube.csv')

superbowl_ads_raw %>%
    select(brand, funny:animals, like_count)

superbowl_ads <-
    superbowl_ads_raw %>%
    select(funny:animals, like_count) %>%
    na.omit()

```

```{r}
library(tidymodels)

rf_spec <- rand_forest(mode = "regression")
rf_form <- like_count ~ .

rf_fit <-
    workflow(rf_form, rf_spec) %>%
    fit(superbowl_ads)
```

Data scientists use tools they love for these steps, like the tidyverse, pandas, tidymodels, scikit-learn, etc.

## Deploy a model

Create a deployable model object:

```{r}
library(vetiver)
v <- vetiver_model(rf_fit, "superbowl_rf")
v
```

Version and share the model:

```{r}
library(pins)


model_board <- board_connect(
    auth = "envvar",
    server = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER"), # Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER")
    account = "tidymodels",
    key = Sys.getenv("VETIVER_API"))

model_board %>% vetiver_pin_write(v)



```

Document model: <https://vetiver.tidymodels.org/articles/model-card.html>

Deploy model as a REST API:

```{r}
library(plumber)
pr() %>%
    vetiver_api(v, debug = TRUE) %>%
    pr_run()
```


```{r}
vetiver_deploy_rsconnect(
    model_board,
    "superbowl_rf",
    predict_args = list(debug = TRUE),
    account = "tidymodels"
)

```



```{r}
new_ads <- superbowl_ads %>% select(-like_count) %>% slice_sample(n = 3)
new_ads


```


Predict for remote vetiver model:

```{r}
## source train-rf.R
vet_api_key <- Sys.getenv("VETIVER_API")
superbowl_endpoint <-  vetiver_endpoint(Sys.getenv("phil_endpoint_super"))

# superbowl_endpoint <- vetiver_endpoint("http://ec2-18-216-69-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/rsconnect/predict2/")
superbowl_endpoint
```

```{r}
# predict(superbowl_endpoint, new_ads)

predict(superbowl_endpoint, new_ads, httr::add_headers(Authorization = paste("Key", vet_api_key)))
```

## Example APIs to explore:

-   Predict whether content on Netflix is a TV show or movie (unstructured text data): <https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/netflix-descriptions/>

-   Predict ridership at Chicago Clark & Lake "L" station (complex time series, robust checking of new data): <https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/chicago-ridership-api/>

## What's next for vetiver?

Monitoring, easier deployment to cloud platforms
